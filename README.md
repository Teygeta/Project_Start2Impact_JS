## About The Project

<img src="./img/App_Screen.png" width="400" style="border-radius: 10px" alt="App_screen"/>

This project is made during the course of study I am doing through the [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/) platform, to certify the skills learned.
It represents a simple counter that allows you to add, subtract, save and reset a numerical value.
The project is fine to comply with all the directions suggested by the [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/) team.
